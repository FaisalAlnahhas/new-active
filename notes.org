Functional pearl about 'active'

* Titles/focus?

"Programming with active values"
"Programming with bounded functional functional values"
?

Focus just on 'active' part?  Or generalize to arbitrary vector spaces
as well?

* To do

  + Polish 'active' library and get it released... generate some
    discussion etc.

  + split out 'Bounded' (well, rename it 'Envelope' first) into its
    own package?

* Outline/brainstorming

  + Start with intuition/motivation
  + Build up semantics compositionally
  + Discussion of Apply, Semigroup, etc.
  + Define useful combinators
  + Lots of fun examples

  + Perhaps generalize to any vector space?  Talk about 'Envelope',
    'Boundary', etc.?  Hmmm... maybe not.  They have quite different
    purposes.

* Related work

  + lots of FRP stuff
  + 'Semantic Design w/ Type Class Morphisms' from Conal
  + Haskore(/Euterpea?)
  + ChalkBoard
